# Human Recognition System

## Project Description
**Human Recognition System** is a real-time system that recognizes humans directly through the browser's camera feed without requiring image uploads. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, utilizing image processing algorithms to detect and analyze humans in real-time. The system provides a user-friendly interface and operates entirely within the browser.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-recognition-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd human-recognition-system
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Since the project uses pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, no additional dependencies are required.

4. **Run**:
   Open the project in a browser, allow camera access, and the system will begin performing real-time recognition.

## Usage
1. Once the project is opened in the browser, the system will automatically start using the camera.
2. Human recognition will occur in real-time from the live video feed provided by the camera.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
